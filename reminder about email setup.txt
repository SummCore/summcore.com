Here’s a concise reminder you can save as reminder.md in the project root:
Reminder: Enable silent auto-CC email (EmailJS)
What to do
Create an EmailJS account: https://www.emailjs.com/
Connect an email service and copy the Service ID
Create a template with variables: to_email, from_name, from_email, subject, message; copy the Template ID
Get your Public Key (Account → API Keys)
Security → Allowed Origins: add your site origin(s) (e.g., http://localhost and your production domain)
Where to paste keys
Business Health Check & Audit Tool/businesshealthcheck.html (top script)
Set: EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY, EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID, EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID
Invoicing & Quotation/script.js (inside sendEmail())
Set: EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY, EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID, EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID
Customer Journey Mapper/index.html (top script; Business Plan Templates page)
Set: EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY, EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID, EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID
How it behaves
If keys present: silently emails info@summcore.com via EmailJS, then opens the user’s mail app with cc=info@summcore.com
If keys empty: only opens the user’s mail app
Quick test
Fill keys in the three files
Click Email/Send Results
Verify copy arrives at info@summcore.com
Notes
You can customize the EmailJS template format; keep the same variable names
For deliverability, consider custom domain + SMTP and SPF/DKIM
If you want, I can try writing this file into the repo again now.
please create the file

I’m hitting a write glitch creating the file through the tool. I’ll drop the content here and can try again in the next step if you want me to place it directly.
